                <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these
                    Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

                <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part
                    of the terms then you may not access the Service.
                </p>


                <h2>Accounts</h2>

                <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and
                    current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in
                    immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>

                <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any
                    activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a
                    third-party service.</p>

                <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon
                    becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>


                <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>

                <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled
                    by BeatYourTask.</p>

                <p>BeatYourTask has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies,
                    or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that
                    BeatYourTask shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
                    caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content,

                <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web
                    sites or services that you visit.</p>


                <h2>Governing Law</h2>

                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Baden-Württemberg,
                    Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
                    rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                    remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                    agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
                    have between us regarding the Service.</p>


                <h2>Changes</h2>

                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
                    revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
                    effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

                <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be
                    bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>

                <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent
                    necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its

                <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation
                    (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations
                    such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration,
                    retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making
                    available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal

                <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose,
                    duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in
                    conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to
                    optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also

                <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
                <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have
                    the right</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data
                        being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the
                        data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
                    </li>
                    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
                    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively,
                        if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said
                        processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
                    </li>
                    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same
                        transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
                    </li>
                    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is
                        being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77
                        GDPR).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
                    corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18
                    GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
                    disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
                <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the
                    controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular,
                    an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
                <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
                <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its
                    storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
                    obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
                <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on
                    your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as
                    your browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for
                    example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used
                    to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
                <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in
                    improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
                <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
                <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
                <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose
                    of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
                <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose
                    of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
                <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
                <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the
                    browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required
                    vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or
                    consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot
                    prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your
                    Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are
                    using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your
                    Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
                <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be
                    fully usable.</p>

                <h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
                <p>If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the data you entered during
                    registration (e.g. your name, your address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading
                    up to your potential placement of an order or entering some other contractual relationship with us,
                    to fulfill such orders or contracts, and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an
                    overview of your previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist function). We also store your
                    IP address and the date and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to third
                    parties.</p>
                <p>During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your data, with
                    reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide
                    your customer account.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this
                    processing.</p>
                <p>If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a contractual
                    relationship with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing
                    is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
                <p>You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7
                    Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your
                    consent.</p>
                <p>The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary.
                    However, we must observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.</p>

                <h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
                <p>We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our website,
                    hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts." If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and
                    publish your post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>
                <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art.
                    7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your
                    consent.</p>
                <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed
                    because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post
                    infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
                <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any
                    legal defense we may have to mount.</p>
